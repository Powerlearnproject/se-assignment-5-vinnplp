# SE-Assignment-5
Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. 1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.
Browse to the Official Page of VS Code.
Download the File & execute it.
Accept the Terms & Conditions.
Click on Next & click Install later.
After installation, click on the Launch button.

2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
   Change the path in the  environment variable
   In your extensions add: code runner, python, python debugger, pylance.

3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
VS Code comes with a simple and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor, while leaving ample room to browse and access the full context of your folder or project. The user interface is divided into five main areas:

Editor - The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.
Primary Side Bar - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
Status Bar - Information about the opened project and the files you edit.
Activity Bar - Located on the far left-hand side. Lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled. You can change the position of the Activity Bar.
Panel - An additional space for views below the editor region. By default, it contains output, debug information, errors and warnings, and an integrated terminal. The Panel can also be moved to the left or right for more vertical space.

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
The Command Palette provides access to many commands. You can run editor commands, open files, search for symbols, and see a quick outline of a file, all using the same interactive window. 
5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code. 
In Visual Studio Code, on the Activity Bar, click Extensions (or click View menu > Extensions).
Examples of extensions include: code runner, python, python debugger, pylance.
6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code.
   right-click menu within the workspace: In the file explorer or editor, right-click on any file or empty space. Select "Open in Integrated Terminal" to open the terminal in the current workspace
    What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
 One significant advantage is that they provide a seamless experience for both the business and the customer. Transactions can be processed quickly and efficiently, with all relevant information displayed on the terminal's screen.
7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
Create a file in VS Code:
Open the VS Code project containing your application.
Click the Create File
Select the file group from Select File Group list.
Select the file type from the Select File Type list from the command palette at the top of the screen.
Enter a name for the file in the Create New File dialog box.
Drag a folder onto VS Code to view it in the sidebar. You can also choose File > Open Folder and select a folder you want to open. 
8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? 
   Use the Settings editor to review and change VS Code settings. To open the Settings editor, navigate to File > Preferences > Settings. 
   Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.
Open the settings (File > Preferences > Settings) or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + ,)tThen type “font size” in the search box. You can adjust these settings to your liking. If you want a bigger or smaller font size, simply change the numbers. The “lineHeight” option will adjust the spacing between lines. 
Select the File > Preferences > Theme > File Icon Theme menu item, or use the Preferences: File Icon Theme command to display the File Icon Theme picker. Use the Up and Down keys to navigate through the list and preview the icons of the theme. Select the theme you want and press Enter.
9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
To run or debug a simple app in VS Code, select Run and Debug on the Debug start view or press F5 and VS Code will try to run your currently active file. However, for most debugging scenarios, creating a launch configuration file is beneficial because it allows you to configure and save debugging setup details.
Also select Debug > Toggle Breakpoint, or right-click and select Breakpoint > Insert Breakpoint. The breakpoint appears as a red dot in the left margin next to the line of code. The debugger suspends execution just before the line runs.
10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? 
    Initializing a New Git Repo in VS Code Using the Side Bar Buttons
Create and name a new folder on your machine.
Go to VS Code and select Open beneath the Start menu on the main screen.
Open your newly created file.
Select the source control icon from the Activity Bar.
Click Initialize Repository.
    Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
